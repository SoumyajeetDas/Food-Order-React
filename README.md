This repo contains the frontend of the website "Bengali Food". 
The frontend part is made with React(a frontend JS lib. for UI) and Redux(a state management lib.). 
I have used several other packages to make the frontend colourful. One of them is 'framer-motion'. 
The backend is made with Express, Node JS which are JS libraries.
The DB used is MONGO DB.
